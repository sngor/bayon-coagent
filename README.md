## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Docker and Docker Compose (for local AWS services)
- AWS Account (for production deployment)

### Local Development Setup

#### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project:

```bash
# Environment
NODE_ENV=development
USE_LOCAL_AWS=true

# AWS Configuration
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test

# AWS Services (LocalStack)
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=<from-localstack-init>
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=<from-localstack-init>
DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=BayonCoAgent-local
S3_BUCKET_NAME=bayon-coagent-local

# Bedrock Configuration (uses real AWS)
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0
BEDROCK_REGION=us-east-1

# Google OAuth credentials for Google Business Profile integration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<your-google-client-id>"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="<your-google-client-secret>"
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/api/oauth/google/callback"

# External APIs
BRIDGE_API_KEY="<your-bridge-api-key>"
NEWS_API_KEY="<your-news-api-key>"
TAVILY_API_KEY="<your-tavily-api-key>"
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Start LocalStack (Local AWS Services)

```bash
# Start LocalStack in Docker
npm run localstack:start

# Initialize AWS resources (DynamoDB, S3, Cognito)
npm run localstack:init
```

**Important:** Copy the Cognito User Pool ID and Client ID from the init output and update your `.env.local` file.

#### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Verify Setup

Check that everything is configured correctly:

```bash
npm run verify:setup
```

This will verify:

- Docker is running
- LocalStack is accessible
- Environment variables are set
- AWS resources are created

### Stopping LocalStack

```bash
npm run localstack:stop
```

To completely reset LocalStack data:

```bash
npm run localstack:stop
rm -rf localstack-data
```

For more details, see [AWS Local Development Guide](./docs/aws-local-development.md).

## NPM Scripts Reference

### Development

```bash
npm run dev                 # Start Next.js development server (port 3000)

npm run localstack:stop    # Stop LocalStack
npm run localstack:init    # Initialize AWS resources (DynamoDB, S3, Cognito)
npm run localstack:logs    # View LocalStack logs
npm run verify:setup       # Verify local development setup
```

### Data Migration (Firebase → AWS)

```bash
npm run migrate:export     # Export data from Firestore
npm run migrate:transform  # Transform data to DynamoDB format
npm run migrate:import     # Import data to DynamoDB

## Deployment

### AWS Deployment (Recommended)

The application can be deployed to AWS using several options:

#### Option 1: AWS Amplify Hosting (Easiest)

```bash
# Automated setup
npm run deploy:amplify

# Or manually via AWS Console
# See DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md for details
```

#### Option 2: Vercel with AWS Backend

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

#### Option 3: CloudFront + Lambda (Advanced)

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

### Prerequisites for Deployment

1. **Deploy Infrastructure First**

   ```bash
   npm run infra:install
   npm run infra:deploy:prod
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   cd infrastructure
   ./scripts/update-env.sh production
   ```

3. **Test Deployment**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:test <your-deployment-url>
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### LocalStack Issues

**Problem**: LocalStack won't start

```bash
# Check if Docker is running
docker ps

# Check if port 4566 is available
lsof -i :4566

# Restart Docker Desktop
# Then try again
npm run localstack:start
```

**Problem**: Can't connect to LocalStack services

```bash
# Verify LocalStack is running
curl http://localhost:4566/_localstack/health

# Check environment variables
echo $USE_LOCAL_AWS  # Should be "true"

# Restart LocalStack
npm run localstack:stop
npm run localstack:start
npm run localstack:init
```

### AWS Connection Issues

**Problem**: "Missing credentials" error

```bash
# For local development, ensure .env.local has:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test

# For production, configure AWS CLI:
aws configure
```

**Problem**: "Table not found" in DynamoDB

```bash
# Re-initialize LocalStack resources
npm run localstack:init

# Or create table manually (see AWS_SETUP.md)
```

### Build Issues

**Problem**: TypeScript errors

```bash
# Run type checking
npm run typecheck

# Check for missing dependencies
npm install
```

**Problem**: Build fails

```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Rebuild
npm run build
```

### Application Issues

**Problem**: Authentication not working

- Verify Cognito User Pool ID and Client ID in `.env.local`
- Check that LocalStack is running
- Try creating a test user manually

**Problem**: Data not loading

- Verify DynamoDB table exists: `npm run localstack:init`
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
