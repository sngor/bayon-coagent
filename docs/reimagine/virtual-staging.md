# Virtual Staging Guide

Transform empty rooms into beautifully furnished spaces that help buyers visualize living in the property.

## What is Virtual Staging?

Virtual staging uses AI to add realistic furniture, decor, and accessories to empty room photos. It's a cost-effective alternative to physical staging that can be done in minutes.

## When to Use Virtual Staging

✅ **Perfect for:**

- Vacant properties with empty rooms
- New construction before furniture arrives
- Properties where physical staging is too expensive
- Rooms that need to show multiple layout options

❌ **Not ideal for:**

- Already furnished rooms (use renovation instead)
- Outdoor spaces (no furniture needed)
- Very dark or poorly lit photos

## Before You Start

### Image Requirements

- **Room should be empty** or mostly empty
- **Good lighting** - natural light preferred
- **Clear view** of the entire room
- **Straight angles** - avoid extreme perspectives
- **Clean space** - remove clutter first

### Best Photo Practices

1. **Shoot from doorway height** (about 5 feet)
2. **Include full room** in frame
3. **Turn on all lights** for even lighting
4. **Open curtains/blinds** for natural light
5. **Clean floors and walls** before shooting

## Using Virtual Staging
