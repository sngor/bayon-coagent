## When to Use Item Removal

✅ **Perfect for:**

- Removing clutter from rooms
- Eliminating distracting objects
- Cleaning up outdoor spaces

- Removing items that define the space

## Before You Start

### Image Requirements

- **Clear view** of object to remove
- **Simple background** behind object (easier removal)
- **Good lighting** on area to be filled
- **Reasonable object size** (not entire image)
- **Distinct object boundaries**

### Best Photo Practices

1. **Shoot from straight angle** (not extreme perspectives)
2. **Ensure good lighting** throughout image
3. **Include context** around objects
4. **Avoid shadows** cast by objects when possible
5. **Higher resolution** = better results

## Using Item Removal

### Step 1: Mark Objects for Removal

Use the selection tool to mark what you want removed:

#### Selection Tips

- **Be precise**: Mark only the object, not surrounding area
- **Include shadows**: Mark object's shadow if visible
- **Complete coverage**: Ensure entire object is marked
- **Multiple objects**: Mark all items you want removed
- **Avoid edges**: Don't mark important features nearby

#### Selection Tool

- **Click and drag** to draw around object
- **Adjust selection** by adding or removing areas
- **Zoom in** for precise marking
- **Preview selection** before processing

---

### Step 2: Describe Objects (Optional but Recommended)

Provide brief descriptions of objects being removed:

**Why describe?**

- Helps AI understand context
- Improves background fill quality
- Ensures appropriate replacement
- Better results for complex objects

**Good descriptions:**

- "trash can"
- "car in driveway"
- "for sale sign"
- "power lines"
- "cardboard boxes"

**Avoid:**

- Overly detailed descriptions
- Multiple objects in one description
- Vague terms like "stuff" or "things"

---

### Step 3: Process and Review

After AI processes the removal:

1. **Check fill quality**: Is background natural-looking?
2. **Verify edges**: Are transitions smooth?
3. **Look for artifacts**: Any obvious AI-generated areas?
4. **Compare with original**: Does it look realistic?

If results need improvement:

- **Adjust selection**: Make it more precise
- **Try different description**: Be more specific
- **Regenerate**: AI may produce better result on second try

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- **Remove one category at a time** for best results
- **Mark precisely** around object boundaries
- **Include object shadows** in selection
- **Describe objects** for better AI understanding
- **Process multiple items** in single operation when possible
- **Check edges carefully** in preview
- **Use for privacy** (remove personal items)

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't remove structural elements** (walls, windows, etc.)
- **Don't mark too much** at once (keep it reasonable)
- **Don't expect perfection** on complex backgrounds
- **Don't remove defining features** of the property
- **Don't use on people** (privacy and ethical concerns)
- **Don't remove safety features** (railings, etc.)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Background fill looks unnatural

**Cause**: Complex background pattern or texture
**Solution**:

- Ensure good lighting in original photo
- Try more precise selection
- Provide detailed object description
- Consider if object is too large to remove

### Issue: Edges are visible or blurry

**Cause**: Selection boundary not precise enough
**Solution**:

- Zoom in and refine selection edges
- Include slight margin around object
- Ensure selection follows object contours
- Regenerate with adjusted selection

### Issue: Wrong texture or pattern filled in

**Cause**: AI misunderstood background context
**Solution**:

- Provide clearer object description
- Ensure surrounding area is visible
- Check if background is too complex
- Try regenerating

### Issue: Shadow remains after object removed

**Cause**: Shadow not included in selection
**Solution**:

- Mark shadow area along with object
- Describe "object and shadow"
- Ensure shadow is clearly visible in photo

### Issue: Multiple objects - some removed well, others not

**Cause**: Varying complexity of objects and backgrounds
**Solution**:

- Remove complex objects separately
- Process simpler objects together
- Prioritize most important removals
- Accept and re-edit for additional removals

## Pro Tips

### Maximize Success Rate

1. **Start with simple objects**: Build confidence with easy removals
2. **Good lighting is key**: Well-lit areas fill better
3. **Simple backgrounds**: Grass, walls, floors work best
4. **One type at a time**: Remove all similar objects together
5. **Preview carefully**: Check all edges and transitions

### Strategic Removals
