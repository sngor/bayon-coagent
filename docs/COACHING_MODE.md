## Objection Handling Techniques

### **Feel, Felt, Found**
```
"I understand how you FEEL. Others have FELT the same way. 
What they FOUND was..."
```
**When to use**: Empathizing with common concerns  
**Example**: "I understand how you feel about the commission. Many sellers have felt the same way initially. What they found was that professional marketing and negotiation actually saved them money in the long run."

### **Acknowledge + Reframe**
Validate the concern, then show a different perspective with data or examples.

**When to use**: Addressing misconceptions  
**Example**: "You're right to be concerned about price. Let me show you the comparable sales data that supports this pricing..."

### **Ask Clarifying Questions**
Uncover the real concern behind the objection.

**When to use**: When objection seems surface-level  
**Example**: "What specifically concerns you about the timeline?" or "Can you help me understand what you mean by 'too expensive'?"

### **Trial Close**
Test readiness to move forward if concern is addressed.

**When to use**: After addressing an objection  
**Example**: "If we could address that concern, would you be ready to move forward?" or "Is this the only thing holding you back?"

### **Evidence-Based Response**
Use data, statistics, or examples to support your position.

**When to use**: Factual objections  
**Example**: "According to the latest market data, homes in this price range are selling within 30 days on average..."

### **Isolation Technique**
Identify if this is the only objection or if there are others.

**When to use**: Before investing time in one concern  
**Example**: "Is the commission the only concern, or are there other factors we should discuss?"

## How Coaching Mode Works

### **AI Dual-Role System**

The AI simultaneously plays two roles:

1. **Client Persona**: Stays in character, presents objections naturally
2. **Coach**: Provides subtle guidance and tracks your performance

### **Coaching Intelligence**

The AI coach:
- **Recognizes** when you use effective techniques
- **Responds positively** when you handle objections well
- **Escalates** difficulty if you're doing well
- **Provides hints** if you're struggling
- **Tracks progress** mentally throughout the conversation

### **Adaptive Difficulty**

- Starts with main concern from persona
- Presents 2-3 objections throughout conversation
- Gradually warms up if you handle objections well
- Becomes more resistant if you're pushy or dismissive
- Provides natural opportunities to demonstrate skills
