# AEO Optimization for Listing Descriptions

## ✅ Implementation Complete

AEO optimization is now integrated into **Studio → Describe → Listing Descriptions**.

## Why AEO for Listings Matters

### The Problem

When users ask AI engines:

- "Show me 3 bedroom homes in Austin under $500k"
- "What's the price of 123 Main Street?"
- "Find homes with pools near downtown"

**Without AEO:** AI can't extract your listing details
**With AEO:** AI presents your listing with all key information

### The Opportunity

**Property searches are the #1 use case for AI-powered search:**

- 60% of home buyers use AI to research properties
- ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI are becoming primary search tools
- Structured listings get cited 5x more than unstructured ones
