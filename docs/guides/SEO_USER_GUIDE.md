## Understanding SEO Scores

### What is an SEO Score?

Your SEO score (0-100) measures how well your content is optimized for search engines:

- **80-100**: Excellent - Well optimized
- **60-79**: Good - Minor improvements needed

- **0-39**: Poor - Significant optimization needed

### What Affects Your Score

The system evaluates:

1. **Title Optimization** (50-60 characters is ideal)
2. **Heading Structure** (Proper use of H1, H2, H3)
3. **Keyword Usage** (1-2% density is optimal)
4. **Readability** (Clear sentences, good paragraph length)
5. **Content Length** (1500+ words is ideal for blog posts)
6. **Meta Description** (150-160 characters)

## Using SEO Analysis

### Analyzing Your Content

SEO analysis runs automatically when you create or edit blog posts in **Studio → Write**.

**To manually analyze content**:

1. Open your blog post in **Studio → Write**
2. The SEO analysis appears in the right sidebar
3. View your score and recommendations

### Understanding Recommendations

Recommendations are prioritized to help you focus:

#### High Priority (Red)

Critical issues that significantly impact SEO:

- Missing or poor title
- No heading structure
- Very short content
- Missing meta description

#### Medium Priority (Yellow)

Important improvements:

- Title too long or too short
- Keyword density issues
- Readability concerns
- Suboptimal content length

#### Low Priority (Blue)

Nice-to-have optimizations:

- Minor heading improvements
- Additional keyword opportunities
- Content structure refinements

### Applying Recommendations

Each recommendation shows:

- **Current Value**: What you have now
- **Suggested Value**: What to change it to
- **Apply Button**: Click to automatically apply the suggestion

**Example**:

```
Priority: High
Category: Title
Message: Title is too long at 72 characters
Current: "The Complete Guide to Buying Your First Home in Seattle: Everything You Need to Know"
Suggested: "First Home Buyer's Guide to Seattle Real Estate 2024"
[Apply]
```

### Best Practices

1. **Start with high priority**: Fix critical issues first
2. **Review suggestions**: Don't blindly apply all recommendations
3. **Maintain your voice**: Keep your writing style while optimizing
4. **Re-analyze after changes**: Check if your score improved

### Understanding Keyword Data

Each keyword shows:

- **Keyword Phrase**: The search term
- **Search Volume**: Estimated monthly searches
- **Competition**: Low, Medium, or High
- **Rationale**: Why this keyword is relevant

**Example**:

```
Keyword: "Capitol Hill homes for sale Seattle"
Search Volume: 480/month

Rationale: Neighborhood-specific with good search volume and manageable competition
```

### Saving Keywords

Build your keyword library:

   - Throughout content (1-2% density)

### Keyword Best Practices

   - Short-tail: "Seattle real estate" (high volume, high competition)

2. **Target local keywords**:

   - Include your city/neighborhood

## Optimizing Meta Descriptions

### What is a Meta Description?

The meta description is the text that appears under your page title in search results. It's your chance to convince people to click.

**Example**:

```
Title: Seattle Real Estate Market Trends 2024
Meta Description: Discover the latest Seattle real estate trends,
including price changes, inventory levels, and buyer demand.
Expert insights from local agent John Smith.
```

### Auto-Generated Meta Descriptions

When you create a blog post:

1. The system automatically generates a meta description
2. It includes your primary keyword
3. It's optimized to 150-160 characters
4. It includes a call-to-action

### Editing Meta Descriptions

To customize your meta description:

1. Find the **Meta Description** field in your blog post editor
2. Edit the text
3. Watch the character counter (aim for 150-160)
4. Ensure it includes your primary keyword

### Character Count Warnings

- **Under 150 characters**: Warning - Too short, may not be compelling
- **150-160 characters**: ✓ Optimal length
- **Over 160 characters**: Warning - May be truncated in search results

### Writing Effective Meta Descriptions

**Do**:

- Include your primary keyword
- Add a clear call-to-action
- Mention your location
- Be specific and compelling
- Use active voice

**Don't**:

- Stuff with keywords
- Use generic descriptions
- Exceed 160 characters
- Duplicate across pages
- Use special characters excessively

**Good Example**:

```
"Looking for Capitol Hill homes? Browse 50+ listings with expert
guidance from Seattle realtor Jane Smith. Schedule your tour today!"
(158 characters)
```

**Bad Example**:

```
"Real estate homes houses for sale Seattle Capitol Hill Queen Anne
Ballard Fremont homes real estate agent realtor buy sell"
(Too many keywords, no value proposition)
```

## Schema Markup Validation

### What is Schema Markup?

To check if your schema markup is correct:

**Invalid Schema** ✗:

### Fixing Schema Issues

Common issues and solutions:

**Missing Profile Information**:

**Missing Blog Post Data**:

- Add publish date
- Verify author information

**Missing Testimonial Data**:

- Add client name

### Testing Your Schema
