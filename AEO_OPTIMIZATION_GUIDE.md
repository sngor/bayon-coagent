# AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) Guide

## What is AEO?

AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) is the practice of optimizing content for AI-powered search engines and language models, including:

- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **Perplexity** (AI-powered search)
- **Google AI Overviews** (formerly SGE)
- **Bing Copilot** (Microsoft)
- **Other LLM-powered search engines**

## Why AEO Matters

### Traditional SEO vs. AEO

**Traditional SEO:**

- Optimizes for Google's algorithm
- Focuses on keywords and backlinks
- Goal: Rank in top 10 results
- Users click through to your site

**AEO:**

- Optimizes for AI extraction and presentation
- Focuses on structure and clarity
- Goal: Be cited in AI responses
- Users see your content in AI answers

### The Shift to AI Search

**Statistics:**

- 40% of searches now use AI-powered tools
- ChatGPT has 100M+ weekly users
- Google AI Overviews appear in 15% of searches
- Perplexity handles 500M+ queries/month

**Impact:**

- AI engines extract and present information directly

- Being cited by AI = massive visibility
- Not being AI-friendly = invisible to AI users
