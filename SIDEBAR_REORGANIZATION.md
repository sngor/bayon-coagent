# Sidebar Navigation Reorganization

## Overview

The sidebar navigation has been reorganized to better align with user workflows and the natural progression of real estate agent activities.

## New Navigation Structure

### 1. Core Overview & Communication

- **Dashboard** - Central overview and metrics
- **Assistant** - AI chat assistant for immediate help

### 2. Primary Business Workflow

- **Brand** - Brand identity & strategy (Profile, Audit, Competitors, Strategy)
- **Studio** - Content creation (Write, Describe, Reimagine)
- **Research** - AI-powered research and market intelligence (Research Agent, Reports, Knowledge Base)

### 3. Business Tools & Management

- **Tools** - Deal analysis & calculations (Calculator, ROI, Valuation)
- **Library** - Content & knowledge management (Content, Reports, Media, Templates)

### 4. Client & Business Operations

- **Clients** - Client dashboard management
- **Open House** - Open house management tools

### 5. Learning & Administration

- **Learning** - Training and educational content
- **Admin** - Administrative functions (admin users only)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Logical Flow Organization

- **Moved Assistant to top**: Quick access to AI help from anywhere
- **Grouped core workflow**: Brand → Studio → Research follows the natural agent workflow
- **Positioned tools strategically**: After content creation, when agents need calculations

### 2. Renamed for Clarity

- **Intelligence → Research**: More intuitive name that clearly indicates market research and analysis capabilities

### 3. Workflow-Based Grouping

- **Brand Building First**: Agents start by establishing their brand identity
- **Content Creation Second**: Once brand is established, create content
- **Research Support**: Research supports both brand building and content creation
- **Tools for Analysis**: Deal analysis tools when working with clients
- **Library for Management**: Access to all created content and reports

### 4. User Journey Alignment

The new structure follows the key user flows identified in the product overview:

1. **Onboarding Flow**: Dashboard → Brand → Studio
2. **Content Creation Flow**: Studio → Research → Library
3. **Client Work Flow**: Research → Tools → Clients
4. **Learning Flow**: Learning (easily accessible at bottom)

## Benefits of This Organization

### 1. Intuitive Workflow

- Follows the natural progression of real estate agent activities
- Reduces cognitive load by grouping related functions
- Makes the most frequently used features easily accessible

### 2. Better User Experience

- Assistant at top for immediate help
- Core business functions (Brand, Studio, Research) prominently placed
- Support functions (Learning, Admin) at bottom where expected

### 3. Scalability

- Clear categories make it easy to add new features
- Logical grouping supports future hub expansions
- Maintains clean, organized appearance

## Implementation Notes

- The `/intelligence` route remains unchanged in the codebase
- Only the navigation label was updated to "Research" for better clarity
- All existing functionality and routing continues to work as before
- The reorganization is purely structural for better UX

This reorganization creates a more intuitive and workflow-oriented navigation that better serves real estate agents' daily activities and business processes.
